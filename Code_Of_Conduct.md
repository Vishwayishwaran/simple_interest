Code of Conduct
We want to create a positive and respectful environment for everyone contributing to this project. Please follow these guidelines:

Be respectful: Treat others with kindness and respect. Disagreements are fine, but be polite.
Be inclusive: Welcome all individuals, regardless of their background or experience level.
No harassment: Harassment, bullying, or any inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
Constructive feedback: Provide helpful feedback, and be open to receiving it. Focus on making the project better.
Report issues: If you notice any unacceptable behavior, please report it to vishwayishwaran@gmail.com.
Letâ€™s keep this a friendly place for everyone!

Notes:
Keep the email where people can report issues up-to-date.
This simplified version is perfect for smaller projects or communities where a light code of conduct is sufficient.
